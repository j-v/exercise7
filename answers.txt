a) Any pizza is food

Yes I think so, express that pizza is a subclass of food

EXAMPLE

<rdf:Class rdf:ID="Food">
 <rdf:comment>People all around the world enjoy food.</rdfs:comment>
</rdf:Class>
<rdf:Class rdf:ID="Pizza">
 <rdf:comment>Some people are not fortunate enough to enjoy Pizza.</rdfs:comment>
 <rdf:subClassOf rdf:resource="#Food"/>
</rdf:Class>

b) Pizzas always have at least two toppings
No, RDF(S) cannot express cardinality constraints.

c) Any pizza of the class PizzaMargherita has tomato as a topping
Don't think so, RDF(S) cannot express existence constraints.

d)Everything that has a topping is a pizza
hmm
Don't think so, a property can be used by any class.

e) No pizza of the class PizzaMargherita has a topping of the class Meat
